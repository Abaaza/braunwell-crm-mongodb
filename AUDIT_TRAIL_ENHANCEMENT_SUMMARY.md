# Enhanced Audit Trail System for CRM Application

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive audit trail system that has been implemented to track all sensitive operations in the CRM application. The system provides detailed logging, security monitoring, data retention policies, and compliance features.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Audit Schema

The audit logging system has been upgraded with the following fields:

- **Basic Information**: action, entityType, entityId, userId, timestamp
- **Change Tracking**: changes (JSON diff of old vs new values)
- **Security Context**: ipAddress, userAgent, sessionId
- **Risk Assessment**: severity, riskScore, category
- **Operational Details**: successful, errorMessage, affectedRecords
- **Data Classification**: dataClassification (public, internal, confidential, restricted)
- **Metadata**: additional context as JSON

### 2. Comprehensive Audit Utilities

## Implementation Details

### Schema Changes

```typescript
auditLogs: defineTable({
  // Basic fields
  action: v.string(),
  entityType: v.string(),
  entityId: v.string(),
  userId: v.id("users"),
  timestamp: v.number(),
  
  // Enhanced fields
  changes: v.optional(v.string()),
  ipAddress: v.optional(v.string()),
  userAgent: v.optional(v.string()),
  sessionId: v.optional(v.string()),
  severity: v.optional(v.union(v.literal("low"), v.literal("medium"), v.literal("high"), v.literal("critical"))),
  category: v.optional(v.string()),
  description: v.optional(v.string()),
  metadata: v.optional(v.string()),
  riskScore: v.optional(v.number()),
  successful: v.optional(v.boolean()),
  errorMessage: v.optional(v.string()),
  affectedRecords: v.optional(v.number()),
  dataClassification: v.optional(v.union(v.literal("public"), v.literal("internal"), v.literal("confidential"), v.literal("restricted"))),
})
```

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

The system calculates risk scores based on:
1. **Action Type**: Higher scores for delete, export, admin actions
2. **Entity Sensitivity**: Users, permissions, settings get higher scores
3. **Time Patterns**: Off-hours activity increases risk
4. **Bulk Operations**: Large-scale operations get higher risk
5. **Failure Patterns**: Failed operations indicate potential issues

### Security Alert Triggers

1. **Multiple Failed Logins**: 5+ failures per user in 5 minutes
2. **High IP Activity**: 100+ actions from single IP in 24 hours
3. **Multiple Users Same IP**: 3+ users from same IP
4. **High-Risk Actions**: 10+ actions with risk score > 70 in 24 hours

## Usage Examples

### Basic Audit Logging

```typescript
import { createAuditLog } from "./auditUtils"

// In a mutation
await createAuditLog(ctx, auditContext, {
  action: "updated",
  entityType: "contacts",
  entityId: contactId,
  changes: { name: { from: "Old Name", to: "New Name" } },
  severity: "medium",
  description: "Updated contact information",
})
```

### Enhanced Contact Operations

```typescript
// Create with audit context
const result = await api.contacts.create({
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "+1234567890",
  userId: "user123",
  ipAddress: "192.168.1.100",
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0...",
  sessionId: "session_abc123",
})
```

### Client-Side Context

```typescript
import { setAuditContext, withAuditContext } from "@/lib/audit-context"

// Set context on login
setAuditContext({
  userId: user.id,
  ipAddress: await IPUtils.getClientIP(),
  userAgent: navigator.userAgent,
  sessionId: "session_123",
})

// Use in components
const enhancedArgs = withAuditContext({
  name: "New Contact",
  email: "contact@example.com",
})
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Sensitive fields are automatically sanitized in audit logs
- Password hashes, tokens, and keys are redacted
- Personal information is handled according to data classification

### Access Control
- Only administrators can access audit logs
- Manual cleanup requires admin privileges
- Export functionality is logged and restricted

### Performance
- Audit logging is asynchronous to avoid blocking operations
- Bulk operations are batched to prevent timeouts
- Indexes are optimized for common query patterns

## Compliance Features

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR**: Data classification and retention policies
- **HIPAA**: Audit trails for healthcare data access
- **SOX**: Financial transaction logging
- **ISO 27001**: Security event monitoring

### Audit Requirements
- Tamper-evident logging (immutable once written)
- Comprehensive coverage of all data operations
- Retention policies matching regulatory requirements
- Export capabilities for auditor review

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring
- Security alerts displayed in admin interface
- Email notifications for critical events (can be configured)
- Integration points for SIEM systems

### Reporting
- Monthly security reports
- Compliance export functionality
- Trend analysis and anomaly detection

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection using ML models
2. **Integration**: SIEM system integration
3. **Real-time Alerts**: Email/SMS notifications
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Behavioral analysis and threat detection
5. **Geo-location**: IP-based location tracking
6. **API Rate Limiting**: Automatic throttling based on risk scores

### Scalability Considerations
- Log archival to external storage systems
- Database partitioning for large-scale deployments
- Distributed logging for microservices architecture
